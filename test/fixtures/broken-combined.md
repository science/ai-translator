arise in relation to each of the basic human energy centers or chak-
ras, offering keys to understand how healers may be caught by
these energies. She demonstrates through example and exercises
how the fears and needs of the healers, sexually, financially, emo-
tionally, and spiritually can become entangled with their clients,
especially with the heightened sensitivity and suggestibility found
in regressed and transpersonal dimensions.

```
To read and take to heart this book requires a great degree of
truthfulness on the part of the reader. To reflect on The Ethics of
Caring is healing and therapeutic in itself, as it brings our con-
sciousness to the potential shadow areas of all healing relation-
ships. Through the exercises provided, and by thoughtful consid-
eration, a healer can use this book to awaken a whole new level
of awareness in the areas which have the greatest potential to
bring conflict and harm.

Ww hile studying to obtain my master's degree in marriage
and family counseling, I was required to take a course in ethics.
Although touching on philosophical issues, this course was more
like a law course than a counseling course. Because of state licens-
ing requirements, the professor's emphasis was on teaching us
how to avoid litigation rather than on encouraging us to examine
our own values, motivations, and relationships with our clients.
