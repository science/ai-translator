# Author’s Note

**T**he life experiences we each have and share are intimate and sacred; they belong to us and can never be fully grasped by others—the best a reader can do is hear them, interpret them, and learn from them. They are on loan, with the original pulse stored within those who lived them. This is why I am utterly grateful for all who were willing to share their stories with me, who were willing to offer me the most precious glimpses into their existence.  
This book is rooted in my theoretical and clinical expertise, but it is inspired by my own experiences and conversations that I’ve had with people I know and work with. Every client, friend, and research participant has been given a pseudonym and has had their identifying characteristics changed. The conversations I recall have been altered in an effort to protect privacy and honor confidentiality. In addition, my biographical details are at times slightly tweaked as a way to preserve my own sense of privacy and safety, while still maintaining the integrity of my own lived experience.  
Lastly, philosophy is a tricky beast and although I’ve done my best to distill some complex ideas, I encourage you to do your own reading and reach your own truth.  
 

# I Don’t Know Who I Am

**“A**re you happy?”  
The question catches me off-guard, as does my instinct to respond: *No, not at all. I am simply enduring the fact that I am alive.*  
I am stunned.  
I’m twenty-four years old, visiting L.A. for the weekend and having drinks with a close friend from college, someone I haven’t seen much since graduation. The conversation had been light—reminiscing about our carefree days at school, cringing and laughing at the memories. But then he’d leveled me with the seemingly innocuous question:  
“Are you happy?”  
While I don’t say it out loud, this is the first time I’ve *allowed* myself to acknowledge the fact that I am deeply unhappy. *Why now?* At this intersection of truth and raw emotion—the moment I will, years later, recognize in my clients when they realize, suddenly and irrepressibly, that an aspect of their life no longer feels honest to them—tears begin to roll down my face. My friend stares at me, bewildered.  
I sit there, feeling ambushed and betrayed by my body. My chest starts to heave as my lungs fight to find air between sobs. I don’t say anything; instead, I plummet into disjointed and booming thoughts.

*I am deeply, profoundly unhappy.*

*I don’t know who I am anymore—and I don’t remember the last time I did.*

*I feel broken—but I don’t remember breaking.*

I tell my friend I need to use the bathroom. Unsteadily, I find my way to the sink and grasp its edges to anchor myself. A scream is building inside of me, but I don’t let it out. I splash water on my face and neck, hoping the cold will snap me back into a reality that hurts a little less.  
When I finally look in the mirror, I am met with hollow, unfamiliar eyes. They’re empty. *Is anyone even in there?* I lift my arm to wipe my face, and the stranger mirrors me. The woman touching my cheeks is me, but *she* doesn’t feel like *me*. I feel utterly disconnected from the person staring back. *Is this who everyone else sees?*  
I am dizzy, inexplicably overwhelmed.  
Then, it finally dawns on me: *I HATE the woman in the mirror.* I am confused, frustrated, and constantly hurt by her. Fuck her\! I suffer as she just watches me live a life that I am not even sure is worth living.  
*So, no…*  
“I am not happy,” I finally say out loud, in an empty bathroom, to no one in particular.

The next morning, I have a plane to catch—my sister and I have been in Los Angeles for a “girls’ trip” and are heading back home to Vancouver. I was able to pull myself together at the bar the night before, but now the dread of going back to my “real” life is palpable. As I pack my bag, I feel heavier with each piece of clothing I put in my suitcase. I begin to wonder about all the people, things, and roles I’ve “placed” into my life that weren’t meant for me. Then I quickly chastise myself, feeling ungrateful, even ashamed of my discontent. By the age of nine, I had survived the Bosnia and Kosovo Wars, and the fact that I am alive, healthy, and living in Canada is an enormous and wonderful privilege. I have food, shelter, and fresh ocean air. *Things are good\!*  
But of course, this forced positivity only makes me feel shittier.  
The truth is, I am finding it hard to be grateful these days. I live in a dark, crappy one-bedroom basement apartment that my husband and I can barely afford. The beat-up van I drive makes an embarrassing amount of noise every time I push the brake. I got married the summer before grad school, at the tender age of twenty-two, and in the conservative, Christian community in which I grew up, no one flinched as I made such a huge commitment before my frontal cortex had even fully developed. *Why didn’t anyone stop me*? I wonder. Now I come home to a husband I don’t love. Luckily, I am gone most days attending classes and studying for my master’s program in counseling psychology—but even my refuge is exhausting and competitive. With each assignment, my flaws and past traumas have become glaringly obvious. In addition to my academic requirements, I am asked to learn about and navigate other people’s emotional pain in therapy sessions, while simultaneously trying to manage my own. I spend a lot of my time daydreaming about having a very different life—fantasizing about the endless could-have-beens—as a way to cope with my reality. Lately I’ve noticed that my senses have dulled, making me feel detached, almost, from my own existence.  
I feel pressured to be someone I am not and to live a life that I don’t want. People assume my life is fun, sweet, idyllic even, and it’s become my job to keep up the pretenses—the perfect marriage, the slim figure, the academic accomplishments. Yet, as hard as I try, I feel like I’m failing—myself and the people around me.  
*I am drowning.*  
I am asked to be many things: wife, student, therapist, friend, daughter, and sibling. But no one is asking me to be my Self, to show up as who I really am—and it wouldn’t matter if they did, because even I don’t know who that really is. I have no space to unravel my thoughts or decipher my feelings, although maybe that’s just an excuse, because I have the sneaking suspicion that if I did, I would come undone. I feel trapped, frightened that all my decisions—big and small—have set a sentence, without parole, for a life I don’t want. Deep down, I know that the only way to escape is to shatter my life as I know it.  
But what if, in the process, *I* shatter instead? What if I break before I can break free?
